            <p>So, does it matter what the Oxford English Dictionary has to say about femininity?</p>
            <p>The short answer is: yes, yes it does.</p>
            <p>Dictionaries exist not just to provide definitions of obscure words like ______ or _______, but also to re ect the current usage and connotations of every day language. When the Oxford English Dictionary o ers ‘she celebrates her femininity by wearing make-up and high heels’ as an example of how to use the word ‘femininity,’ it shapes our expectations of what femininity looks like.</p>
            <p>This is what people mean when they say that ‘you can’t be what you can’t see’. If we cannot imagine ‘femininity’ looks like anything but ‘make-up’ and ‘high heels’, we send the message that girls are only valued for their looks and their beauty. If we impose these limits on the word ‘femininity’, we impose limits on female aspirations.</p>
            <p>People are often quick to overlook the small things in life. But it is exactly these things that can harm our society and prevent us from moving forwards. By challenging the things we disagree with, we can e ect change and begin to carve out a space for bravery, creativity and originality.
            So over to you. We want to know what the word femininity means to you. What do you think femininity looks like — or should, or could look like? Sumbit your example sentance above or tweet us using the hashtag xxx</p>
