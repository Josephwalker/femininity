            <p>Honestly. We think we can do better than that. By doing it together. Tell us what you think ‘femininity’ means. Tell us what you think it doesn’t mean.</p>
            <p>Who knows, it might even end up in the Oxford English Dictionary one day.

            <p>So, does it matter what the Oxford English Dictionary has to say about femininity?</p>
            <p>The short answer is: yes, yes it does.</p>
            <p>Dictionaries exist not just to provide definitions of obscure polysyllabic words (like polysyllabic) but also to re ect the current usage and connotations of every day language. When the Oxford English Dictionary o ers ‘she celebrates her femininity by wearing make-up and high heels’ as an example of how to use the word femininity, it shapes our expectations of what femininity looks like.</p>
            <p>This is what people mean when they say ‘you can’t be what you can’t see’. If we cannot imagine femininity looks like anything but ‘make-up’ and ‘high heels’, we send the message that girls are only valued for their looks and their beauty.</p>
            <p>We need institutions such as the Oxford English Dictionary to lead by example and give girls positive empowering messages about who they are and who they can be. By shaping the meaning of words like femininity, we can carve out a space for bravery, creativity and originality.</p>
            <p>So over to you. We want to know what the word femininity means to you. What do you think femininity looks like — or should, or could look like? We’ll select one of your examples to headline the campaign and propose to the OED.
